Instructions for installing the editor.


= Details =

  # Download latest binary
  # In Eclipse, go to Help -> Install New Software
  # If you haven't added a software site for the Euphoria editor, add a new one.  Otherwise, ensure that the software site's location is pointing at the downloaded zip file.
  # Once the repository is added and selected, ensure that Group items by category is *not* checked, otherwise the the editor will not show up in the available software to install.
  # Select the editor and finish the wizard.  The installer will prompt about installing unsigned content and will likely ask to restart Eclipse once the plug-in is installed.
  # Once the installation is complete, the syntax coloring for strings needs to be configured manually. This is a known issue and will be fixed in the next release. Go to Window -> Preferences and in the preferences window go to Euphoria -> Editor -> Syntax Coloring and select a color for strings.
